# Governance model

In open source, governance is described in the "governance model" document, defined by [OSSWatch](http://oss-watch.ac.uk/resources/governancemodels) as follows:
<table>
  <tr>
    <td>
      A governance model describes the roles that project participants can take on and the process for decision making within the project. In addition, it describes the ground rules for participation in the project and the processes for communicating and sharing within the project team and community.
    </td>
  </tr>
</table>

## Mission
This Open Source project aims at providing a set of useful resources either to create an Open Source project from scratch, or to help adding missing ones to an existing project.

Given its own nature, it is open to anyone for improvements and contributions, so anyone can propose changes and additions just by following the [contribution guidelines](/CONTRIBUTING.md).


## Roles

Find below a common set of roles that could be defined for any project.

| Role  | Members | Objective |
| -     | -       | -         |
| Trusted Committer  | Daniel Izquierdo<br />Alberto Pérez<br />Jesús Alonso  | Is the Host Team. Responsible for both building the house and setting the house rules to ensure their guests are comfortable and can work together effectively.  |
| Champion | - | Act as focal point within the project to help  advance the plan, establish and implement processes, policies, methodology, and achieve milestones. |
| Contributor | Anyone willing to help :) | Makes contributions to the project. These contributions could be code or non-code artifacts, such as bug reports, feature requests, or documentation (may or may not be part of the community). |

**It is worth noting that the Champion is added here for reference**. This project does not need it, but it could be useful for others, so we keep it here as a template.

## Forums and committees

This project doesn't have any meeting, nevertheless below there is a list of meetings at the project level and at the methodology level that could generally apply to most of the projects, so you can use this list as starting point.
