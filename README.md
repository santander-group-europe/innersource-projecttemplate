# InnerSource Project Template

This project offers a **template** that can be used by anyone willing to create a new project based on resources that are commonly used in **Open Source** projects.

It is a template, but at the same time contains the information of the project itself, so it is an example of its application itself.

Despite of the title, **it should work either for InnerSource or Open Source projects**. Of course it is far from being perfect nor complete, it is just one possible approach. So, it is open to modifications either on your side or by proposing changes to this template via Pull Request. Something that is useful for you, can also be useful for others.
